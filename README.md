The repository contains two scripts. The first is generate.py, which allows you to generate an array of data in .csv format. To do this, you need to write in the script these parameters and the full path with the name of the file where the dataset will be saved. The second one is main.py, which contains the solution of the problem. In it you also need to specify the path to the dataset

The script requires python version 3.10 and the libraries listed in the requirements.txt file
